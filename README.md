# Object Transformation Estimation using Template Matching and SAM Segmentation

This script demonstrates the process of estimating the transformation (rotation and translation) between a template image and a test image using template matching and SAM segmentation. It uses the ORB feature detector to compute keypoints and descriptors for both the template and test images. The keypoints are matched between the images using a brute-force matcher. The segmented masks generated by the SAM segmentation algorithm are used to compute the keypoints and descriptors.
